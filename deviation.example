Let's break down the notation for standard deviation:

σ = √[(1/N) * ∑(x[n] - μ)^2]

Here's how to read it:

σ (sigma) represents the standard deviation.
√ means "take the square root of".
1/N means "divide by the total number of samples" (N).
∑ (sigma) means "sum of". Think of it like a big "add up all these values" symbol.
(x[n] - μ) means "each sample value minus the mean value". This is calculating the deviation of each sample from the mean.
^2 means "squared". So, (x[n] - μ)^2 is the squared deviation.

So, when you see σ = √[(1/N) * ∑(x[n] - μ)^2], you can translate it to:

For each sample value, subtract the mean value: (x[1] - μ), (x[2] - μ), ..., (x[N] - μ)
Square each of these deviations: (x[1] - μ)^2, (x[2] - μ)^2, ..., (x[N] - μ)^2
Add up these squared deviations: (x[1] - μ)^2 + (x[2] - μ)^2 + ... + (x[N] - μ)^2
Divide the sum by the total number of samples: [(x[1] - μ)^2 + (x[2] - μ)^2 + ... + (x[N] - μ)^2] / N
Take the square root of the result: √[(x[1] - μ)^2 + (x[2] - μ)^2 + ... + (x[N] - μ)^2] / N

In simpler terms, it's calculating the spread of the sample values from the mean, and 
then taking the square root to get the standard deviation.
