Let's consider an example. Suppose you're analyzing the daily temperatures in a city over a week. 
You collect the following temperature data:

Day 1: 22°C
Day 2: 23°C
Day 3: 21°C
Day 4: 24°C
Day 5: 22°C
Day 6: 20°C
Day 7: 23°C

Calculating the mean:

Mean = (22 + 23 + 21 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 23) / 7 ≈ 22.14°C

The mean gives you an idea of the average temperature over the week.

Calculating the standard deviation:

Let's assume the standard deviation is approximately 1.26°C (after calculating).

The standard deviation tells you that most temperatures are likely to be within 1.26°C of the mean (22.14°C). 
So, you can expect temperatures to usually be between 20.88°C and 23.40°C.

Calculating the variance:

Variance = σ^2 = (1.26)^2 ≈ 1.59

The variance is used in more advanced calculations, such as determining the spread of temperatures in a more theoretical sense.

Practical use:

Weather forecasting: Knowing the mean and standard deviation of temperatures can help you predict the likelihood of certain temperature ranges.
Climate analysis: Understanding the variance of temperatures can help researchers identify patterns or trends in climate data.

In signal processing, these concepts are applied in various ways, such as:

Noise analysis: Understanding the mean and standard deviation of noise can help you design filters to reduce its impact.
Signal characterization: Analyzing the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a signal can help you understand its properties and behavior.

These are just a few examples, but the concepts of mean, standard deviation, and variance are widely used in many fields.
