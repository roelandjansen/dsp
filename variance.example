Let's break down the notation for variance:

σ^2 = (1/N) * ∑(x[n] - μ)^2

Here's how to read it:

σ^2 (sigma squared) represents the variance.
1/N means "divide by the total number of samples" (N).
∑ (sigma) means "sum of". Think of it like a big "add up all these values" symbol.
(x[n] - μ) means "each sample value minus the mean value". This is calculating the deviation of each sample from the mean.
^2 means "squared". So, (x[n] - μ)^2 is the squared deviation.

So, when you see σ^2 = (1/N) * ∑(x[n] - μ)^2, you can translate it to:

For each sample value, subtract the mean value: (x[1] - μ), (x[2] - μ), ..., (x[N] - μ)
Square each of these deviations: (x[1] - μ)^2, (x[2] - μ)^2, ..., (x[N] - μ)^2
Add up these squared deviations: (x[1] - μ)^2 + (x[2] - μ)^2 + ... + (x[N] - μ)^2
Divide the sum by the total number of samples: [(x[1] - μ)^2 + (x[2] - μ)^2 + ... + (x[N] - μ)^2] / N

In simpler terms, it's calculating the average of the squared deviations from the mean.

Notice that this is similar to the standard deviation formula, but without the square root at the end. 
That's why variance is often referred to as the "squared" version of standard deviation.
