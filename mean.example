he mathematical notation can be intimidating at first, but it's actually a concise way to represent the concepts.

Let's break down the notation for the mean:

μ = (1/N) * ∑x[n]

Here's how to read it:

μ (mu) represents the mean value.
∑ (sigma) means "sum of". Think of it like a big "add up all these values" symbol.
x[n] represents each individual sample value. The [n] part means "each sample in the set".
1/N means "divide by the total number of samples" (N).

So, when you see μ = (1/N) * ∑x[n], you can translate it to:

"Mean (μ) equals the sum of all sample values (∑x[n]) divided by the total number of samples (1/N)".

In simpler terms, it's the same as:

Mean = (add up all sample values) / (total number of samples)

You can think of it like this:

Add up all the sample values: x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + ... + x[N]
Divide the sum by the total number of samples: (x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + ... + x[N]) / N
